# CMB_power_spectrum
This repository will store the code used to compute the CMB power spectrum. I will update it as I progress with this project for the course AST5220 - Cosmology II of the University of Oslo (UiO). The structure of the repository and the code is based on Hans A. Whinter's (HAWinther).
